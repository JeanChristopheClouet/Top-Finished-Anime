This error typically occurs due to incorrect syntax or characters that YAML doesn't recognize. In YAML, it's important to use the correct structure and indentation. Based on your previous request, it might be related to how certain characters or formatting are interpreted.

Here's a quick reminder of how the README should look:

---

YAML doesn't handle markdown the same way as other files, so ensure that there are no unintended characters or misformatted lines in your YAML file. If you continue to face issues, feel free to share more details or specific lines that are causing trouble.
